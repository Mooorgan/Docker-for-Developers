**Develop and run your application with Docker containers using DevOps tools for continuous delivery**

## What is this book about?
Docker is the de facto standard for containerizing apps, and with an increasing number of software projects migrating to containers, it is crucial for engineers and DevOps teams to understand how to build, deploy, and secure Docker environments effectively. Docker for Developers will help you understand Docker containers from scratch while taking you through best practices and showing you how to address security concerns.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Get up to speed with creating containers and understand how they work
* Package and deploy your containers to a variety of platforms
* Work with containers in the cloud and on the Kubernetes platform
* Deploy and then monitor the health and logs of running containers
* Explore best practices for working with containers from a security perspective

## Abstract

Docker is the de-facto standard for containerizing applications. It allows developers to run the same software on their workstations in the same way it will run on a cluster of servers in production, while simplifying many configuration and deployment issues. 

With an increasing number of software projects migrating to containers, to reduce cost, complexity and improve portability it is crucial for engineering and DevOps teams to understand how to build and deploy secure Docker environments.

If you are new to container-based development, this book walks you through three keys areas, how to build containers and develop software using the containers, how to deploy them in Cloud environments, and how to ensure they are secure. 

This book provides a synthesis of three important areas of Docker based development (creation, deployment and securing containers) through a hands-on approach. The book can be read cover to cover or dived into by section, for those looking for help with a specific topic. 

You’ll learn how containers works and how to create and development projects within them. Following this you will learn how to deploy them to the cloud using DevOps techniques and ensure that security is taken into consideration from start to finish. 

By the end of this book you will understand how containers work, how to develop within them, how to deploy Docker containers to a variety of environments, including both a local learning environment and a Cloud Native Kubernetes cluster using the AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and you will learn security best practices along the way.

Regardless of whether you are a DevOps engineer, a Software Engineering lead, or a software developer looking for ways to create a sane environment, learning how to build and deploy applications in Docker will make you a stronger practitioner!

# Getting Started

Please [purchase the book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1789536057) and follow the exercises in each chapter to follow along. The code within is organized by chapter.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, `chapter2`.

The code will look like the following:
```
if (test expression)
{
  Statement upon condition is true
}
```

## What you need for this book
If you’re a software engineer new to containerization or a DevOps engineer responsible for deploying Docker containers in the cloud and building DevOps pipelines for container-based projects, you’ll find this book useful. This Docker containers book is also a handy reference guide for anyone working with a Docker-based DevOps ecosystem or interested in understanding the security implications and best practices for working in container-driven environments.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-16).
